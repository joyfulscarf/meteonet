Dew Point The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. When further cooled, the airborne water vapour will condense to form liquid water (dew). When air cools to its dew point through contact with a surface that is colder than the air, water will condense on the surface. 2. Geopotential height Geopotential height or geopotential altitude is a vertical coordinate referenced to Earth's mean sea level, an adjustment to geometric height (altitude above mean sea level) that accounts for the variation of gravity with latitude and altitude. Thus, it can be considered a \"gravity-adjusted height\". The geopotential height is interesting in meteorology because it allows to measure constant pressure levels. It roughly represents the height above sea level of a pressure level. For example, if a station reports that the 500 mb [i.e. millibar] height at its location is 5600 m, it means that the level of the atmosphere over that station at which the atmospheric pressure is 500 mb is 5600 meters above sea level. This is an estimated height based on temperature and pressure data. A high geopotential height is often associated to an anticyclone and a low geopotential height corresponds to a depression. 3. Pseudo-adiabatic Potential Temperature of The Wet Bulb It indicates the temperature of an air particle would have if it is raised by an adiabatic process until its condensation level, then brought down to a 1000hPa level by a pseudoadiabatic process, while remaining satured without evaporation during its descent. This parameters allows to compare the temperature of samples of air that are at different altitudes. This parameter is very useful in meteorology to track the dynamic areas of a depression. 4. Vertical Velocity The vertical velocity is the vertical speed of a mass of air. The displacement is expressed in Pa (in meteorology, the vertical levels are often expressed in isobar levels, see Weather Models for more details). The higher the height, the lower the pressure. If the vertical velocity is positive, there is an upward current (ex : the earth surface is warmed by the sun). The opposite corresponds to a downdraft (ex : an cold air mass passes above a warmer ground). 5. Wind Components The U and V wind components are the two horizontal wind speed vector components : U : from west to east V : from south to north 6. Brightness Temperature A descriptive measure of radiation in terms of the temperature of a hypothetical blackbody emitting an identical amount of radiation at the same wavelength. For more information, cf the Glossary of the Meterology of the AMS , the American Meteorological Society. 7. Troposphere That portion of the atmosphere from the earth's surface to the tropopause; that is, the lowest 1020 km (612 mi) of the atmosphere; the portion of the atmosphere where most weather occurs. For more information, cf the Glossary of the Meterology of the AMS . 8. Tropopause The boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, usually characterized by an abrupt change of lapse rate. For more information, cf the Glossary of the Meterology of the AMS . 9. Potential Vorticity A quantity which is proportional to the product of vorticity and stratification. When applied to air parcels, aids the understanding of cyclogenesis. 10. Jet Stream Relatively strong winds concentrated within a narrow stream in the atmosphere. For more information, cf the Glossary of the Meterology of the AMS .","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"english/glossary/#glossary","text":"This glossary is here to help you understand some specific meteorological terms.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"english/glossary/#1-dew-point","text":"The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor.

Requirements The following packages are required to use our toolbox : Python 3 and conda or pip . 2. Dowload the repository Copy the repository from our GitHub page or run : git clone https://github.com/meteofrance/meteonet.git 3. Install dependencies We noticed some version incompatility issues between packages, especially during installation of basemap librairies like Cartopy. So it is recommended to use virtual environments (using conda if you have Anaconda : https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/ or virtualenv of you use pip : https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/ ). Once you created your virtual environment, you just have to run the following commands : ** Conda (from scratch) conda env create - f environment . yml #yml file at the root of the repository conda activate meteonet_toolbox #activate the created environment ** Conda (from an existing environment) #if necessary (it is about basic packages) #conda install -c anaconda numpy>=1.14.0 #conda install -c anaconda pandas>=0.24.0 #conda install -c anaconda scipy #conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib conda install - c conda - forge eccodes conda install - c conda - forge cfgrib conda install - c anaconda xarray Pip pip install - r requirements . txt ** Conda is the recommended way 4. Install the package Once the dependencies are installed, you can install the meteonet_toolbox package. Naviguate to the directory where you have cloned the repository, and run : pip install -e . 5. Install Jupyter Notebook To be able to open our notebooks and use the example code we provided, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook : ** Conda (from scratch) #nothing to do, already done! ** Conda (from an existing environment) #if necessary (it is about basic packages) #conda install -c conda-forge notebook Pip pip install jupyter Once the installation is done, navigate inside the repository and run : jupyter notebook You should be able to open each notebook and explore the sample data. 6. (Optional) Install Cartopy ( master branch) This new mapping library replaces Basemap since 2020. If you want to plot nice maps with your data, you can use the cartopy library. The recommended installation method uses anaconda through the conda-forge channel: ** Conda (from scratch) #nothing to do, already done! ** Conda (from an existing environment) conda install - c conda - forge cartopy Pip #The list of Cartopy dependencies can be found on this page : https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html. #Required version of PROJ is 4.9.0 or later. #Shapely should be install with: pip install shapely -- no - binary shapely pip install Cartopy 7. (Optional) Install Basemap ( basemap branch) Warning As the basemap library is not maintained anymore since 2020, you could have installation issues. We updated the toolbox with a more recent mapping library, Cartopy. If you have tried another libraries, don't hesitate to make a pull request ! If you want to plot nice maps with your data, you can use the basemap library. The recommended installation method uses anaconda through the anaconda channel as basemap is no longer uploaded to PyPI due to its size and non-python external dependencies : conda install -c anaconda basemap For some distributions, this installation of basemap is not sufficient. You might need to install basemap-data-hires : conda install basemap-data-hires 8. Troubleshooting You could run into issues when trying to import and/or use the xarray or basemap librairies. Note It seems that the library Eccodes (used with the xarray library to open GRIB files) can create conflicts with other packages. In a future version, we will stop using the GRIB format and convert the data to the netCDF format, which is more common and should pose less intallation issues. ECCODES ERROR : Unable to find boot.def, the environment variable ECCODES_DEFINITION_PATH is defined but incorrect The solution is to indicate the path to the file boot.def by adding an ECCODES_DEFINITION_PATH environment variable.

Radar Data For each radar data type, you will find one archive per year and per zone, each one sliced in periods of 10 or 11 days (each month is separated in 3 files). Each .npz file contains 3 arrays : data : an array containing maps of radar data values. dates : an array containing a datetime object and indicating the date of each data map. miss_dates : an array containing a datetime object for each missing radar map over the period. The time step between two radar scans is 5 min. The radar starts scanning at 00h every day and ends at 23h55. So each file of 11 days should contain a maximum of 3168 rainfall maps (minus the missing dates). The radar's spatial resolution is 0.01\u00b0 and the projection system used is EPSG:4326. You will also find a radar_coords_ZONE.npz file containing 2 arrays lats and lons , indicating the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the center of each radar pixel. 2.

Rain Radar Quality Code 3.1 Description For each pixel of the rainfall product is associated a quality code with values ranging between 0 (very bad) and 100 (perfect), the values are in percents. If the value is missing, then the value is 255. The rain radar quality code data is organized as specified here . The original data was to heavy to be manipulated so the quality code data are divided into 2 files : rainfall_mean_quality_DATE.npz contains the quality code's average over a day and for each pixel. rainfall_diff_quality_DATE.npz contains the difference between the original value and the average over the day for each pixel. Info Remark about the average quality code computation : if there is no value for a whole day on 1 pixel, it will be indicated as a missing value in the mean file, else the mean computation is done over the non missing values for 1 day and 1 pixel. 3.2 Files organization The files are stored in the same way as the cumulated Rainfall (4 compression levels). At the month level, the files are split into two categories : mean and diff (cf part Description above). For example, for the NW zone, year 2016, January, there are two files : rainfall-mean-quality-code-NW-2016-01.tar.gz rainfall-diff-quality-code-NW-2016-01.tar.gz Example Here are the paths for the NW zone, year 2016, January, first part of month (from day 1 to day 9) : mean data : /data/NW/radar/rainfall_quality_code/ NW_rainfall_quality_code_2016.tar.gz/ NW_rainfall_quality_code_2016.tar/ NW_rainfall_quality_code_2016/ rainfall- mean -quality-code-NW-2016-01.tar.gz/ rainfall- mean -quality-code-NW-2016-01.tar/ rainfall- mean -quality-code-NW-2016-01/ rainfall_ mean _quality-code_NW_2016_01.1.npz diff data : /data/NW/radar/rainfall_quality_code/ NW_rainfall_quality_code_2016.tar.gz/ NW_rainfall_quality_code_2016.tar/ NW_rainfall_quality_code_2016/ rainfall- diff -quality-code-NW-2016-01.tar.gz/ rainfall- diff -quality-code-NW-2016-01.tar/ rainfall- diff -quality-code-NW-2016-01/ rainfall_ diff _quality-code_NW_2016_01.1.npz 4. Reflectivity The reflectivity is a measure of the efficiency of a radar target in intercepting and returning radio energy. Each radar emits a signal which is partly reflected by the precipitation and returned to the radar's receiver. The returned signal's power is then compared to a reference power density at a distance of 1 meter from the radar's antenna before computing the reflectivity. The reflectivity factor Z is measured in decibels (dBZ), which can be approximated to a rainfall rate R , expressed in millimeter per hour (mm/h), using the Marshall-Palmer relation: Z = 200.R^{1.6} \\iff R = (\\frac{Z}{200})^\\frac{1}{1.6} Info The 200 and 1.6 coefficients depend on the type of rain and are specific to mainland France. In 2018, METEO FRANCE introduced a new reflectivity product, with additional data (rainfall probability, height measures,...), which definitively replaced the old product in November 2018. Consequently, during the first part of 2018, the two products overlap and both data are available in the dataset. 4.1 Old Product 4.1.1 Description Warning The old product data range from 01/01/2016 to 30/10/18 included. The rain radar data are organized as specified here . Each pixel of the data array contains a reflectivity value expressed in dBZ, computed using the lower bound of reflecivity levels as follows : Level Reflectivity Range Data value 0 Z < 8 dBZ 0 1 8 < Z < 16 dBZ 8 2 16 < Z < 20 dBZ 16 N 17 + N < Z < 18 + N dBZ 17 + N 53 70 \\leq Z dBZ 70 255 No value or missing data 255 4.1.2 Files organization The files are stored in the same way as the cumulated Rainfall (4 compression levels).

The new reflectivity product introduced the following changes : a new data processing algorithm the reflectivity minimum detection threshold reduced from 8 to -9 dBZ the reflectivity values with a step of 0.5 dBZ 2 additionnal products : rain probability and selected measure height The rain radar data are organized as specified here , with 2 additionnals arrays prob and height , and contains the following data : data : reflectivity values (in 1/10 dBZ) prob : rain probability (in %) height : selected measure height (in m) The ' non detection data ' value is -100 and the ' missing data ' value is -200. 4.2.2 Files organization The files are stored in the same way as the cumulated Rainfall (4 compression levels).

The color palette is in black & white: In black: in the dry zones where the water vapor concentrates to low atmospheric layers In white: in a very wet atmosphere at high altitude What are the use cases and the limitations of the infrared channels in meteorology? Use cases: Visualize the water vapor circulation and distribution at high altitude (high troposphere ). Observe the tropopause anomalies ( potential vorticity maximum in altitude), the vertical movements and sometimes the jet streams .

The color palette is in black & white: In black: in the dry zones where the water vapor concentrates to low atmospheric layers In white: in a very wet atmosphere at high altitude What are the use cases and the limitations of the infrared channels in meteorology? Use cases: Visualize the water vapor circulation and distribution at high altitude (high troposphere ). Observe the tropopause anomalies ( potential vorticity maximum in altitude), the vertical movements and sometimes the jet streams . Limitations: That measure is very sensitive to temperature, so it can be difficult to analyze in winter on continental areas or in summer on hot areas. A parallax effect is not corrected into the satellite data in MeteoNet (cf Note above for more details).","title":"2.5.1 Description"},{"location":"english/data/satellite/#26-files-organization","text":"The files are stored by zone and per year: NW zone: /data/NW/satellite/WV062_NW_\"year\".nc SE zone: /data/SE/satellite/WV062_SE_\"year\".nc","title":"2.6 Files organization"},{"location":"english/data/summary/","text":"Dataset Summary The data cover two geographical zones, North-West and South-East of France, during three years, 2016 to 2018.

METEO FRANCE's Forecast Models M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France produces several models to forecast the weather. These models are based on physical equations modelling the physical behaviours influencing the weather, such as atmospheric or oceanic phenomenons... They compute a lot of weather parameters (temperature, wind speed, humidity...) at different points on the globe in 4 dimensions (latitude, longitude, height and time). Each model runs several times a day at a fixed time. Each execution is called a ' run '. Each time-step for which we have weather forecasts is called a ' valid time '. On the globe's surface, the points are spaced with regular latitude and longitude steps : this mesh of points is called a grid. On the vertical axis (height), the points are not necessarily regurlarly spaced; the vertical levels can be expressed in height levels in meters or in isobar levels in hPa. The isobar are levels for which the pressure is constant. The 2 main models of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France are AROME and ARPEGE . They do no have the same purposes but they are complementary. ARPEGE is used to forecast the weather at a high scale in space and time. AROME is used to forecast the weather at a finer scale in space and time. Model Name Horizontal Spatial Resolution Number of runs per day Time scale ARPEGE 0.1\u00b0 (~10km) 4 forecasts up to 102 hours ahead AROME 0.025\u00b0 (~1km) 8 forecasts up to 48 hours ahead All these characteristics are the result of compromises between the need for precision and for long time scale and the computing times and costs. In pratice, ARPEGE is used to forecast the weather on Europe and AROME is used to forecast the weather on France. In the dataset, we provided the results of 2D models (forecasts are on a grid longitude x latitude) and 3D models (forecasts are on a grid longitude x latitude x height). Warning Some files in the model files are incomplete/corrupted. It comes from the database of our corporation. There are archiving anomalies. We are working on a new version of MeteoNet and will take into account these anomalies. Meanwhile, we provide the lists of corrupted file names. You can find them directly in CSV files, in the same directories with the weather model data. You can also detect these anomalies by checking the file sizes. For a given file category (zone, level, model type), the files must have exactly the same size. So if some files are smaller than the other one, then these files have anomalies. This has been reported in kaggle in this discussion https://www.kaggle.com/katerpillar/meteonet/discussion/157206 and in Github ( https://github.com/meteofrance/meteonet/issues/14 ). 2. 2D Parameters 2.1 Description Two 2D weather models are available in the dataset : the fine-mesh French weather model named ' AROME '. the large-mesh French weather model named ' ARPEGE '. For each geographical zone, the two models were run each day at 00h and their forecasts range from 00h to 24h, with a time step of 1h. For each model, the data is stored in 4 different GRIB files, depending on the vertical level of the parameters : File Name Vertical Level Forecasted Parameters 2m 2 meters Temperature (K), Dew point (K), Relative humidity (%) 10m 10 meters Wind speed (m.s -1 ), Wind direction (\u00b0), U and V wind components (m.s -1 ) P_sea_level sea level Mean sea level pressure (Pa) PRECIP ground level Total precipitation (kg.m -2 which is equivalent to mm) since the beginning of the model run Warning The total precipitation parameter forecast begins at 1h, and not 0h as the other parameters. For now it is about total precipitation since the beginning of the model run. It is planned in a future version to modify that parameter in order to have the total precipitation between two time steps instead. Info When you open a GRIB file with the xarray library by default, a new associated .idx file is created. You can avoid that file creation by adding an option in the opening command : backend_kwargs={\"indexpath\" : \"\"} (cf notebook examples). 2.2 Files organization The files are stored with 4 compression levels : two per year (.tar.gz and .tar) two per month (.tar.gz and .tar). Then, the data are stored, in this order, by : Weather forecast model : AROME or ARPEGE Vertical level : 2m, 10m, P_sea_level or PRECIP One file per day Example Here is the path for the NW zone, year 2016, January, AROME model, 2m vertical level, day 1: /data/NW/weather_models/2D_parameters/ NW_weather_models_2D_parameters_2016.tar.gz/ NW_weather_models_2D_parameters_2016.tar/ NW_weather_models_2D_parameters_2016/ NW_weather_models_2D_parameters_201601.tar.gz/ NW_weather_models_2D_parameters_201601.tar/ 201601/AROME/2m/ arome_2m_NW_20160101000000.grib 3. 3D Parameters 3.1 Description One 3D weather model is avaible : the large-mesh French weather model named ' ARPEGE '. For each geographical zone (NW and SE), the model was run each day at 00h and its forecasts range from 00h to 24h. The time-step between forecasts vary depending on the time of the day : from 0h to 12h, forecasts are available each hour, and from 12h to 24h, forecasts are available every three hours. Indeed, the model is more precise for the first hours of the days, closer to the moment the model was run, and its precision degrades as time passes. The 3D data is stored in 2 different GRIB files, depending on the vertical level of the parameters : File Name Vertical Levels Forecasted Parameters height 20, 100, 500, 875, 1375, 2000 and 3000 m Pressure (Pa) isobar 1000, 950, 925, 850, 700, 600 and 500 hPa Temperature (K), Pseudo-adiabatic potential temperature of the wet bulb (K), Relative humidity (%), Wind speed (m.s -1 ), Wind direction (\u00b0), U and V wind components (m.s -1 ), vertical velocity (Pa.s -1 ), geopotential (m 2 .s -2 ) 3.2 Files organization The files are stored with 4 compression levels : two per year (.tar.gz and .tar) two per month (.tar.gz and .tar).
