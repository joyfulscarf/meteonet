## Cloud Type (CT) data

### Description

You will find one NetCDF file per geographic zone ('NW' for North-West of France and 'SE' for South-East of France) and per year. 

For each pixel, the value represents a category of cloud type (16 classes in total):

* 0:No data
* 1:Cloud-free land
* 2:Cloud-free sea
* 3:Snow over land
* 4:Sea ice
* 5:Very low clouds
* 6:Low clouds
* ...

The spatial resolution is 0.03Â° and the time step is 15 minutes but some dates can be missing (due to problems in original data, so we can do anything.

It is about a METEO FRANCE data fusion product. It combines different outputs (satellite imagery, numerical weather prediction parameters..etc) to compute the Cloud Type product. For more information, cf the [official documentation](https://www.nwcsaf.org/Downloads/GEO/2018/Documents/Scientific_Docs/NWC-CDOP3-GEO-MF-CMS-SCI-UM-Cloud_v1.0.pdf) (from page 26).

### Files organization

The files are stored by zone and per year:

* NW zone: */data/NW/satellite/CT_NW_"year".nc*
* SE zone: */data/SE/satellite/CT_SE_"year".nc*
